Guidelines for Contributing
===========================

This repository holds my individual solutions and attempts at the challenges of the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). As such, I will not accept pull requests. Nor should you expect opening an issue to prompt any changes in this codebase. Feel free to instead use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/AshleyWright/AdventOfCode/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc) as a collection of questions in why I made certain choices in my solutions.
